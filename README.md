# SQL_JSON_Wrangle_OpenStreetMap_Data_Final_Project
Final Project for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Data Wrangling Module

This is a project that I completed for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Data Wrangling Module.
I used SQL to wrangle the data.

Read the Read_Me_First... file.
Copy all of the files that I am submitting with this project into the same directory.
Run the program called “data.py”.

The pdf documents are my project submission and the review by the Udacity team.

I was a new SQL learner at this point.
I've since received / completed the Udacity certificate for the Data Analyst Nanodegree, 
but I'm still learning, and will continue learning and practicing. :)
The other documents are background only.
